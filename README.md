# Mario Reinforcement Learning with Gym and Stable Baselines3

This repository contains an IPython Notebook (`mario_reinforcement_learning.ipynb`) for training a reinforcement learning agent to play the classic video game Mario using OpenAI Gym and Stable Baselines3. The agent is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.
